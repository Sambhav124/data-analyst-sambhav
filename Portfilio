# Projects
Project 1: AWS Data Analytic Platform - Phase 1
This project focuses on creating a scalable and secure data analytics platform to process and analyze urban challenges in the City of Vancouver using AWS. Phase 1 centers on Illegal Dumping Cases and addresses issues such as:

Pipeline 1: Data ingestion and profiling from multiple sources like web and mobile.
Pipeline 2: Data cleaning and schema validation using AWS Glue DataBrew.
Pipeline 3: SQL-based exploratory analysis through Amazon Athena.
Pipeline 4: Secure data storage using S3 buckets with KMS encryption and versioning.
Pipeline 5: Visualizing processed data using CloudWatch dashboards.
Architecture Overview:
Amazon S3 for raw and processed data storage.
AWS Glue for ETL processing and data cataloging.
Amazon Athena for querying and analysis.
CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and insights.
Project 2: AWS Data Analytic Platform - Phase 2
Phase 2 expands the platform's functionality to include additional datasets and analyses for High Water Consumption and Graffiti Cases. This phase emphasizes enhancing data security and observability.

Pipeline 1: Enrichment of datasets using AWS Glue DataBrew.
Pipeline 2: Advanced SQL queries for spatial and temporal analysis via Athena.
Pipeline 3: Data governance using Glue for sensitive data detection and quality checks.
Pipeline 4: Observability features using CloudWatch for real-time cost monitoring and performance insights.
Pipeline 5: Secure replication using cross-bucket rules with KMS.
Architecture Enhancements:
Inclusion of conditional routing for data based on quality checks.
Additional widgets in CloudWatch for cost, resource usage, and data growth.
Implementation Steps (Summary for both Phases):
Data Ingestion: Uploaded datasets into Amazon S3, organized by processing stages (raw, cleaned, processed).
Data Profiling and Cleaning: Used AWS Glue DataBrew for profiling and handling missing values, schema mismatches, and transformations.
Analysis and Insights: Queried datasets in Athena to derive insights and trends.
Visualization: Configured CloudWatch dashboards for stakeholder-friendly insights.
